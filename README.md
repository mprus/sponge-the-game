# sponge-the-game

Actually this is a kata for a vanilla js programming. 
Game is a simple. A user is controlling a square (or any shape you like) at the left side of the map and has to 
avoid enemis which are spwaning at the right side of the map. The enemies are moving from right to left side in a line. 
User can controll its shape only verterically.
